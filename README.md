# RamirezM-MadLib---Endpoint

to start the program you will have to start the debug in vs code you will then have to go into the debug console and copy the urls from there
it should look like this the number may diffrent http://localhost:5028 

you will then need to add 
/MadLib/Madness/{Fadjective}/{creature}/{gender}/{Event}/{Fverb}/{Sadjective}/{Fnoun}/{Sverb}/{Tadjective}/{Snoun}

everything within the curely brackets may be replaced with what they prompt you however gender should be he/she/they

so your url should look like this 
diffrent http://localhost:5028/MadLib/Madness/{Fadjective}/{creature}/{gender}/{Event}/{Fverb}/{Sadjective}/{Fnoun}/{Sverb}/{Tadjective}/{Snoun}

if you don't change anything it will give you this  
The {Fadjective} {creature} felt sad so {gender} decided they were going to set up {Event} 
after {gender} {Fverb} the {Fnoun} {Sverb} filled with {Sadjective} {gender} then decided to invite all the {Tadjective} {Snoun} to the building
